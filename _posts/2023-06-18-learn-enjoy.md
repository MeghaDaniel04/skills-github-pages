#### Nowaday's most of the people do not enjoy what they do and do you know what is the reason behind it???🙄🙄🙄
Yes...... you thought🤓🤓 it right, nobody loves ❤️ what they do and just do their works for the sake of money🤑 and other such matters.
And children also feel the same while studying...thinking it to be a tiring process.![HotSweatingGIF](https://github.com/MeghaDaniel04/skills-github-pages/assets/128500794/fe60bcce-b3f4-4bcc-9fa3-c1dd124246be)

But what will happen if study by just loving it with your full heart and learn not just to score marks rather do it to explore new things.
## Learn!Enjoy  Learn!Enjoy  Learn!Enjoy learn to explore and just LOVE IT
